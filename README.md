## About The Project

Advanced Vehicle Sirens (AVS) are very similar to what ImVehFt is, however, AVS has (almost) no limits. For example, IVF restricts you to 16 coronas per vehicle model; AVS doesn't restrict you to any count of coronas at all (literally), however, restricts you to 255 sirens. Each siren can have an unlimited amount of coronas. This means that for flashing taillights, for example, you only need, two dummies and one material.

AVS also introduces a couple of additional functions, such as spotlights, siren states, siren mute, automatic paint jobs, hold left to steer with mouse.
